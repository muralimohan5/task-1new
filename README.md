This project is a responsive multi-page website built using Bootstrap 5, featuring a dark theme with black background. It consists of three pages: Home, About, and Contact, designed to be professional and modern.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5 (via CDN)
- Bootstrap Icons

## File Structure
- `index.html` - Home page with navbar, hero section, features, and footer
- `about.html` - About page with services overview, why choose us, and goals
- `features.html` - Features page with detailed feature explanations and goals section
- `contact.html` - Contact page with contact information and form
- `README.md` - This file

## Step-by-Step Development Process
1. **Setup**: Created the project structure and included Bootstrap 5 CDN links.
2. **Component Exploration**: Reviewed Bootstrap 5 documentation and examples to identify reusable components like navbar, cards, forms, and list groups.
3. **Page Design**: Built each page by remixing components - navbar for navigation, hero section for introduction, cards for features/services, list groups for additional content, and forms for contact.
4. **Styling**: Applied a consistent dark theme with black background, using Bootstrap utilities and minimal custom CSS for professional appearance.
5. **Responsiveness**: Ensured all pages are responsive using Bootstrap's grid system and utilities.
6. **Enhancements**: Added logo icon, contact details, and additional form fields.
7. **Testing**: Verified functionality and appearance across different screen sizes.
8. **Deployment**: Prepared for GitHub Pages hosting.

## Bootstrap Components Used

## Challenges Faced and Solutions
