## Project Reflection

### Step-by-Step Process
1. **Setup**: Created the project directory and initialized with Bootstrap 5 CDN links.
2. **Component Exploration**: Reviewed Bootstrap 5 documentation and examples to identify reusable components like navbar, cards, and forms.
3. **Page Design**: Designed each page by remixing components - navbar for navigation, hero section for introduction, cards for features/services, and a form for contact.
4. **Styling**: Applied a consistent dark theme with black background, using Bootstrap utilities and custom CSS for professional appearance.
5. **Responsiveness**: Ensured all pages are responsive using Bootstrap's grid system and utilities.
6. **Testing**: Verified functionality and appearance across different screen sizes.

### Tools and Resources Used
- Bootstrap 5 official documentation and examples
- No AI tools were used for code generation; all code was written manually based on documentation
- No external snippets were copied; components were remixed from examples

### Challenges Faced and Solutions
- **Dark Theme Implementation**: Initially struggled with form styling in dark mode. Solved by adding custom CSS for form controls to maintain readability.
- **Component Synergy**: Ensuring visual consistency across pages. Addressed by using consistent color scheme and spacing.
- **Responsiveness**: Fine-tuning layouts for mobile. Used Bootstrap's responsive classes effectively.

### Learning Journey
